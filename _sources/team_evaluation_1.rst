    {{ team_name, team_member = get_team_members(user_id, course_name, 'teams.csv') }}

Team: {{ =team_name }}

If there are fewer than five members in your team, simply leave information for those additional members blank. For example, a team of four would complete information for team members 1-3, and leave team member 4 blank.


Role
====
In the following questions, briefly describe the role each team member has played in all aspects of Senior Design I (ECE 4512/4532) and in preparing content for the design constraints and approach documents (GE 3513). A failure to provide details about team and content preparation roles will not earn full credit for this assignment.

Group dynamics
==============
.. shortanswer:: mnFNhFseeU

    Has your group communicated clearly and cooperated successfully? If any group members seem to take charge of all assignments or group members seem uninterested and overly passive in group discussions, detail those issues.


.. shortanswer:: ROrC8yQEPl

    Discuss the reliability and participation of your group members. Has anyone missed a meeting, shown up late, left early, or missed any internal deadlines? If so, please be specific.


Contributions
=============
.. fillintheblank:: EI6i8Wuspa

    Evaluate each team member’s contribution to the **design constraints and approach documents (GE 3513)** by distributing the assignment’s total possible points (100) as you think they should be allocated based on each member’s input. Please note that you are not rating each member on a scale of 0 to 100; rather, you are distributing a total of 100 points across all team members other than yourself (e.g., if everyone has contributed equally on a four-person team, you should give your three team members each a 33.3; if everyone has contributed equally on a five-person team, you should give your four team members each a 25). This rating does not count toward individual grades; rather, it is an opportunity to reveal any problems that might exist within your group. **To aid in transparency, I will make your anonymous ratings available to the entire team.**
